# AliLegacy

**AliLegacy** is a small open-source technical experiment documenting  
a symbolic Solidity contract and a full development workflow  
in a constrained environment (**Android / Termux / ARM64**).

## What this project is

- A personal open-source technical milestone
- A symbolic Solidity smart contract (`AliLegacy`)
- An experiment in **technical sovereignty**, minimal tooling, and accessibility
- Built and maintained in a non-traditional environment (mobile + Termux)

---

## What this project is NOT

- Not affiliated with GitHub or any company
- No employment, payroll, or administrative claims
- No official certification, partnership, or endorsement

---

## Motivation

This project exists to document what is possible when modern Web3
development is approached with limited resources and full transparency.
